bibtex-umlautfixer
==================

Fix german Umlaute and other funky characters in bibtex files automagically so
people can focus on their actual work (except you are the person who was 
fixing bibtex files for money, then you can offload it to a machine and just
take the money/favors now).

This is in no way complete but a quick hack needed at the time. Check
[this](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/57743/how-to-write-%C3%A4-and-other-umlauts-and-accented-letters-in-bibliography) for further reference.
